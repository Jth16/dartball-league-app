                    <li><strong>Playing with Three Players:</strong> Teams may play with three (3) players but the missing 4th spot in the batting order is an automatic out each time that spot comes up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lineup:</strong> Batting order must be declared before the first game and can only be changed between games.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switching Teams:</strong> A player may switch teams only once and cannot return to their previous team.</li>

                    <li><strong>Automatic Outs:</strong> Offenses that result in an automatic out include batting out of order and stepping over the throwing line on a throw.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dimes:</strong> A throw off the board is a "Dime" — the player owes $0.10 at the end of the night. Team dimes for the night are rounded up to the nearest dollar and payable to the league within one week.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throwing Line:</strong> Everyone throws from the back line. Exceptions: Women, Seniors (65+), and kids under 12 may throw from the front line.</li>
